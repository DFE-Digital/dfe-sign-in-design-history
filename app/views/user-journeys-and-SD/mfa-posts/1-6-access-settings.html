        <p class="govuk-body">This journey is an edge case journey and is required due to a security concern. MFA is configurable at a service level and services can choose to turn MFA on or off when they choose to.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">When a service turns off MFA the MFA settings are saved in their profile section therefore users are no longer required to use MFA to login however they can still access their settings.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Should an account be compromised due to MFA no longer being required a third-party could change their MFA settings and have control over MFA on the users account.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Therefore it is required should a service turn off MFA that if a user wishes to change their MFA settings they will be required to use MFA to access these settings.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Who can access this journey?</h2>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>DfE Sign-in users who previosuly required MFA to access at least 1 service</li>
